# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

#### Random Mix — Genre Mix
- **Second "Play All" button removed**: The genre mix section had a redundant play button below the super-genre selector. The top-right button is now context-aware — it plays the genre mix when one is active, otherwise the regular mix.
- **"Play All" disabled during genre mix loading**: The button now stays grayed out with a live progress counter (`n / 50`) until all songs are fully loaded. Clicking while the list was still building sent only the songs loaded so far.
- **Over-fetching fixed**: Genre mix previously fetched up to 100+ songs and sliced to 50 at the end. Now the matched genre list is capped at 50 (randomly sampled when more match) so the total fetch stays close to 50 with no wasted server I/O.
- **Regular mix cache-busting**: `getRandomSongs` requests now include a timestamp parameter, preventing browser/axios from returning a cached response and showing the same list on every remix.
- **Display/state mismatch on remix**: Clicking "Mischen" now clears the current list immediately, ensuring the spinner is shown and the displayed songs always match what "Play All" would send.

#### Queue Panel
- **Hover highlight lost on right-click**: Queue items now retain their hover highlight while a context menu is open for them (`.context-active` CSS class).
- **Song count and total duration**: The queue header now shows the number of tracks and total runtime below the title (e.g. `12 tracks · 47:32`).

#### Context Menu
- **"Favorite" option added for queue items**: Right-clicking a queue item now includes a "Favorite" option, consistent with the song context menu.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

#### Linux AppImage — Modern Distro Compatibility
- **Build upgraded to Ubuntu 24.04**: The AppImage was previously built on Ubuntu 22.04 with WebKitGTK 2.36. On modern distros (CachyOS, Arch, etc.) with Mesa 25.x, `eglGetDisplay(EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY)` returns `EGL_BAD_PARAMETER` and aborts immediately because newer Mesa no longer accepts implicit platform detection. Building on Ubuntu 24.04 bundles WebKitGTK 2.44 which uses the correct `eglGetPlatformDisplay` API.
- **`EGL_PLATFORM=x11` added to AppRun**: Additional safeguard that explicitly tells Mesa's EGL loader to use the X11 platform when the app is running under XWayland.

#### Shell — Update Link
- `shell:allow-open` capability now includes a URL scope (`https://**`), fixing the update toast link that silently did nothing in Tauri v2 without an explicit allow-list.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed

#### Random Albums — Performance & Memory
- **Auto-refresh removed**: The 30-second auto-cycle timer caused 10 React state updates/second (progress bar interval) and a burst of 30 concurrent image fetches on every tick, eventually making the whole app unresponsive. The page now loads once on mount; use the manual refresh button to get a new selection.
- **Concurrent fetch limit**: Image fetches are now capped at 5 simultaneous network requests (was unlimited — 30 at once on every refresh).
- **Object URL memory leak**: The in-memory image cache now caps at 150 entries and revokes old object URLs via `URL.revokeObjectURL()` when evicting. Previously, object URLs accumulated without bound across the entire session.
- **Dangling state updates**: `useCachedUrl` now uses a cancellation flag — if a component unmounts while a fetch is in flight (e.g. during a grid refresh), the resolved URL is discarded instead of calling `setState` on an unmounted component.

#### i18n
- Page title "Neueste" on the New Releases page was hardcoded German. Now uses `t('sidebar.newReleases')`.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

#### Statistics Page — Upgraded
- **Library overview**: Four stat cards at the top showing total Artists, Albums, Songs, and Genres — counts derived from the library in parallel.
- **Recently Played**: Horizontal scroll row showing the last played albums with cover art.
- **Most Played**: Ranked list of the most frequently played tracks.
- **Highest Rated**: List of top-rated tracks by user star rating.
- **Genre Chart**: Visual bar chart of the top genres by song and album count.

#### Playlists Page — Redesigned
- Replaced the card grid with a clean list layout.
- **Sort buttons**: Sort by Name, Tracks, or Duration — click again to toggle ascending/descending.
- **Filter input**: Live search across playlist names.
- Play and delete buttons appear on row hover.

#### Favorites — Songs Section Upgraded
- Tracks now display in a full tracklist layout matching Album Detail: separate `#`, Title, Artist, and Duration columns with a header row.
- Artist name is clickable and navigates to the artist page.
- Right-click context menu on any track (Go to Album, Add to Queue, etc.).
- **"Add all to queue"** button (`btn btn-surface`) next to the section title.

#### Context Menu — Go to Album
- New **Go to Album** option (`Disc3` icon) added for `song` and `queue-item` context menu types.
- Only shown when the song has a known `albumId`.

#### Queue Panel — Meta Box
- Now shows: **Title** (no link) → **Artist** (linked to artist page) → **Album** (linked to album page).
- Removed year display and the old title→album link.

#### Random Mix — Hover Persistence
- Track row stays highlighted while its context menu is open via `.context-active` CSS class.
- Highlight is cleared automatically when the context menu closes.

#### Artist Cards — Redesigned
- `ArtistCardLocal` now matches `AlbumCard` exactly: no padding, full-width square cover via `aspect-ratio: 1`, name and meta below.
- Uses `CachedImage` with `coverArtCacheKey` for proper IndexedDB caching.
- Same `flex: 0 0 clamp(140px, 15vw, 180px)` sizing as album cards — artist cards are no longer oversized.

### Fixed

#### Random Albums — Cover Loading & Manual Refresh
- **Removed `renderKey`**: The album grid was fully remounted on every refresh, restarting all 30 IndexedDB image lookups from scratch. Grid is now stable — only data changes, images stay cached.
- **`loadingRef` guard**: Prevents concurrent fetch calls if the auto-cycle timer fires during a manual refresh.
- **Timer race condition**: Manual refresh now calls `clearTimers()` before `load()`, eliminating the race where the auto-cycle timer fired mid-load.

#### Favorites — Artist Navigation
- Arrow nav buttons in the Artists section now use the same CSS classes as the Albums section (`album-row-section`, `album-row-header`, `album-row-nav`) — consistent styling across both rows.

### Changed
- **AlbumDetail** refactored into a thin orchestrator. Logic extracted into `AlbumHeader` (`src/components/AlbumHeader.tsx`) and `AlbumTrackList` (`src/components/AlbumTrackList.tsx`).
- **German i18n**: "Queue" consistently translated as "Warteschlange" throughout — `queue.shuffle`, `favorites.enqueueAll`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

#### Player Bar — Complete Redesign
- **Waveform seekbar**: Replaces the classic thin slider. A canvas-based waveform with 500 deterministic bars (seeded by `trackId`) fills the full available width. Played portion renders as a blue → mauve gradient with a soft glow; buffered range is slightly brighter; unplayed bars are dimmed to 28% opacity. Click or drag anywhere to seek.
- **New layout**: Single flex row — `[Cover + Track Info] [Transport Controls] [Waveform + Times] [Volume]`. More breathing room for the waveform; controls feel lighter and better proportioned.
- **Queue toggle relocated**: Moved from the bottom player bar to the top-right of the content header — consistent with the sidebar collapse button pattern. Uses `PanelRightClose` / `PanelRight` icons (same family as `PanelLeftClose` / `PanelLeft` in the sidebar).

#### Ambient Stage — MilkDrop Visualizer
- **Butterchurn integration**: Clicking the waveform icon (top-right of the fullscreen player) activates the MilkDrop visualizer powered by [butterchurn](https://github.com/jberg/butterchurn) + `butterchurn-presets`.
- A hidden `<audio>` element is routed through the Web Audio API `AnalyserNode` (not connected to `AudioDestinationNode` — completely silent). The Rust/rodio engine continues to handle actual audio output.
- Starts with a random preset; the shuffle button cycles through all available presets with a 2-second blend transition. Current preset name is shown in the top bar.
- When the visualizer is active, the blurred background, orbs, and overlay are replaced by the canvas.

#### Tracklist — Animated Equalizer Indicator
- The currently **playing** track shows three animated equalizer bars (CSS `scaleY` keyframe animation, staggered timing) instead of a static play icon.
- When **paused**, the static play icon is shown.
- Hovering any other track still shows a play icon.
- Track row alignment fixed: `align-items: center` on the grid row + `.track-num` as flex center — icons and track numbers are now perfectly vertically aligned with the song title.

#### Artist Pages — In-App Browser
- Last.fm and Wikipedia buttons now open a native **Tauri `WebviewWindow`** (1100 × 780, centered) instead of the system browser. Both sites load fully within the app and can be closed independently.
- Required new capabilities: `core:window:allow-create`, `core:webview:allow-create-webview-window`.

#### Update Checker
- Update check now runs **every 10 minutes** during runtime in addition to the initial check 1.5 s after launch.
- Version label in the update toast no longer includes a `v` prefix (shows `1.3.0` instead of `v1.3.0`).

#### Help Page
- New **Random Mix** section: explains the random mix, keyword filter, and super genre mix.
- Updated **Playback** section: waveform seekbar, MilkDrop visualizer, queue shuffle.
- Updated **Library** section: in-app browser for artist links.
- Updated queue entry to reflect the new toggle location.
- **Accordion styling**: open question and answer share a continuous 3 px accent stripe on the left; answer background uses `--bg-app` for clear contrast against the question's `--bg-card`.

### Fixed
- **Version in Settings** was hardcoded to `1.0.12`. Now imported from `package.json` at build time — same source as the sidebar update checker.
- **Hero / Discover duplicate albums**: Both sections previously fetched `random` independently, often showing the same albums. Now a single request fetches 20; `slice(0, 8)` goes to the Hero carousel and `slice(8)` to the Discover row.
- **Active track pulse too aggressive**: Changed from a `background: transparent` flash to a gentle `opacity: 0.6` fade over 3 s — significantly less distracting.

### Changed
- **Blacklist → Keyword Filter**: Renamed throughout UI and i18n (EN + DE) to better reflect that the filter matches genre, title, and album fields — not just genre tags.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

#### Rust Audio Engine (replaces Howler.js)
- **New native audio backend** built in Rust using [rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio). Audio is now decoded and played entirely in the Tauri backend — no more reliance on the WebView's `<audio>` element or GStreamer pipeline quirks.
- Tauri commands: `audio_play`, `audio_pause`, `audio_resume`, `audio_stop`, `audio_seek`, `audio_set_volume`.
- Frontend events: `audio:playing` (with duration), `audio:progress` (every 500 ms), `audio:ended`, `audio:error`.
- Generation counter (`AtomicU64`) ensures stale downloads from skipped tracks are cancelled immediately and do not emit events.
- Wall-clock position tracking (`seek_offset + elapsed`) instead of `sink.empty()` (unreliable in rodio 0.19 for VBR MP3). `audio:ended` fires after two consecutive ticks within 1 second of the track end — avoids false positives near the end without adding latency.
- Seek via `sink.try_seek()` — no pause/play cycle, no spurious `ended` events.
- Volume clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]` on every call.

#### Playback Persistence & Cold-Start Resume
- `currentTrack`, `queue`, `queueIndex`, and `currentTime` are now persisted to `localStorage` via Zustand `partialize`.
- On app restart with a previously loaded track, clicking Play resumes from the saved position without losing the queue.
- Position priority: server play queue position (if > 0) takes precedence over the locally saved value, so cross-device resume works correctly.

#### Random Mix — Genre Filter & Blacklist
- **Exclude audiobooks & radio plays** toggle: filters out songs whose genre, title, or album match a hardcoded list (`Hörbuch`, `Hörspiel`, `Audiobook`, `Spoken Word`, `Podcast`, `Krimi`, `Thriller`, `Speech`, `Fantasy`, `Comedy`, `Literature`, and more).
- **Custom genre blacklist**: add any genre keyword via the collapsible chip panel on the Random Mix page or in Settings → Random Mix. Persisted across sessions.
- **Clickable genre chips** in the tracklist: clicking an unblocked genre tag adds it to the blacklist instantly with 1.5 s visual feedback. Blocked genres are shown in red.
- Blacklist filter checks `song.genre`, `song.title`, and `song.album` to catch mislabelled tracks.

#### Random Mix — Super Genre Mix
- Nine pre-defined **Super Genres** (Metal, Rock, Pop, Electronic, Jazz, Classical, Hip-Hop, Country, World) appear as buttons, auto-generated from the server's genre list — only genres with at least one matching keyword are shown.
- Selecting a Super Genre fetches up to 50 songs distributed across all matched sub-genres in parallel, then shuffles the result.
- **Progressive rendering**: the tracklist appears as soon as the first genre request returns — users with large Metal/Rock libraries no longer stare at a spinner for the entire fetch. A small inline spinner next to the title indicates that more genres are still loading.
- **"Load 10 more"** button: fetches 10 additional songs from the same matched genres and appends them to the play queue.
- Random playlist is automatically hidden while a Genre Mix is active.
- Fetch timeout raised to **45 seconds** per genre request (was 15 s) and `Promise.allSettled` used so a single slow/failing genre does not abort the entire mix.

#### Queue Panel
- **Shuffle button** in the queue header: Fisher-Yates shuffles all queued tracks while keeping the currently playing track at position 0. Button is disabled when the queue has fewer than 2 entries.

#### UI / UX
- **LiveSearch keyboard navigation**: arrow keys navigate the dropdown, Enter selects the highlighted item or navigates to the full search results page, Escape closes the dropdown.
- **Multi-line tooltip support**: add `data-tooltip-wrap` attribute to any element with `data-tooltip` to enable line-wrapping (uses `white-space: pre-line` + `\n` in the string). Respects a 220 px max-width.
- **Genre column info icon** in Random Mix tracklist header: hover tooltip explains the clickable-genre-to-blacklist feature.
- **Update link** in the sidebar now uses Tauri Shell plugin `open()` to launch the system browser correctly — `<a target="_blank">` has no effect inside a Tauri WebView.

### Fixed
- **Songs skipping immediately** (root cause: Tauri v2 IPC maps Rust `snake_case` parameters to **camelCase** on the JS side — `duration_hint` must be `durationHint`). All `invoke()` calls updated.
- **Play button doing nothing after restart**: `currentTrack` was `null` after restart (not persisted). Fixed by adding it to `partialize`.
- **Position not restored after restart**: `initializeFromServerQueue` overwrote the local saved position with the server value even when the server reported 0. Now falls back to the localStorage value when the server position is 0.
- **Genre Mix blank on Metal/Rock**: a single timed-out genre request caused `Promise.all` to reject the entire mix. Replaced with `Promise.allSettled` + 45 s timeout; partial results are shown immediately.
- **Tooltip z-index**: tooltips in the main content area were rendered behind the queue panel. Fixed by giving `.main-content` `z-index: 1`, establishing a stacking context above the queue (which sits later in DOM order).
- **Sidebar title clipping**: "Psysonic" brand text was truncated at narrow viewport widths. Minimum sidebar width raised from 180 px to 200 px.

### Changed
- **Audio architecture**: Howler.js removed. All audio state (`isPlaying`, `isAudioPaused`, `currentTime`, `duration`) is now driven by Tauri events from the Rust engine rather than Howler callbacks.
- **Random Mix layout**: Filter/blacklist panel and Genre Mix buttons are now combined in a two-column card at the top of the page instead of being scattered across the page.
- **Hardcoded genre blacklist** extended with: `Fantasy`, `Comedy`, `Literature`.
- **`getRandomSongs`** now accepts an optional `timeout` parameter (default 15 s) so callers can pass a longer value for large-library scenarios.

## [1.0.12] - 2026-03-14

### Fixed
- **Seek Stop Bug**: Clicking the progress bar a second time no longer stops playback. Root cause: WebKit and GStreamer fire spurious `ended` events immediately after a direct `audioNode.currentTime` seek. A guard now checks `lastSeekAt` + playhead position to silently discard these false alarms.
- **Play/Pause Hang**: Rapidly double-clicking the play/pause button no longer freezes the audio pipeline. A 300 ms lock prevents a second toggle from issuing `pause→play` before GStreamer has finished the previous state transition.
- **Queue DnD (macOS / Windows)**: Drop target index is now calculated from the mouse `clientY` position at drop time instead of refs, eliminating the `dragend`-before-`drop` timing race on macOS WKWebView and Windows WebView2.

### Added
- **Live Now Playing navigation**: Clicking an entry in the Live dropdown now navigates to the corresponding album page.

### Changed
- **Hero blur**: Increased background blur in the Hero section for a more immersive look.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Search Results Page**: Pressing Enter in the search bar now navigates to a dedicated full search results page showing artists, albums, and songs with proper column layout and headers.

### Fixed
- **Search Results Column Alignment**: Artist and album columns in the search results song list are now correctly aligned with their column headers.
- **Search Results Header Alignment**: Fixed column header labels not aligning with song row content (root cause: `auto`-width Format column was sized independently per grid row).

### Changed
- **Gapless Playback removed**: Removed the experimental gapless playback feature. It caused intermittent song skipping and beginning cutoffs and was not reliable enough to ship. Standard sequential playback is used instead.

### Known Issues
- ~~**Seeking**: Seeking may occasionally be unreliable, particularly on Linux/GStreamer.~~ Fixed in 1.0.12.
- ~~**Queue drag & drop (macOS / Windows)**: Queue reordering via drag & drop may not always work correctly on macOS and Windows.~~ Fixed in 1.0.12.

## [1.0.10] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Active Track Highlighting**: The currently playing song is highlighted in album tracklists with a subtle pulsing accent background and a play icon — persists when navigating away and returning.
- **Marquee Title in Fullscreen Player**: Long song titles now scroll smoothly as a marquee instead of being cut off.
- **Clickable Artist / Album in Player Bar**: Clicking the artist name navigates to the artist page; clicking the song title navigates to the album page. Same behaviour in the Queue panel's now-playing strip.
- **Linux App Menu Category**: Application now appears under **Multimedia** in desktop application menus (GNOME, KDE, etc.) instead of "Other".
- **Windows MSI Upgrade Support**: Added stable `upgradeCode` GUID so the MSI installer recognises previous versions and upgrades in-place without requiring manual uninstallation first.

### Fixed
- **Drag & Drop (macOS / Windows)**: Queue reordering now works correctly on macOS WKWebView and Windows WebView2. The previous fix cleared index refs synchronously in `onDragEnd`, which fires before `drop` on both platforms — refs are now cleared with a short delay so `onDropQueue` can read the correct source and destination indices.
- **Settings Dropdowns**: Language and theme selects now have a clearly visible border (was invisible against the card background).
- **Tracklist Format Column**: Removed file size and kHz from the format column — codec and bitrate only. Column moved to the far right, after duration. Width is now dynamic (`auto`).
- **`tauri.conf.json`**: Fixed invalid placement of `shortDescription`/`longDescription` (were incorrectly nested under `bundle.linux`, now at `bundle` level). Removed invalid `nsis.allowDowngrades` field.

### Changed
- **Favorites Icon**: Replaced the incorrect fork icon with a star icon in the Random Mix page, consistent with all other pages.
- **Sidebar**: Removed drag-to-resize handle. Width now adapts dynamically to the viewport via `clamp(180px, 15vw, 220px)`.
- **About Section**: Added "Developed with the support of Claude Code by Anthropic" credit. Fixed "weiterzugeben" wording in German MIT licence text.
- **Minimize to Tray**: Now disabled by default.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Gapless Playback**: The next track's audio pipeline is silently pre-warmed before the current track ends, eliminating the gap between songs — especially noticeable on live albums and concept records.
- **Pre-caching**: Prefetched Howl instances are now actually reused for playback, giving near-instant track transitions instead of a new HTTP connection each time.
- **Buffered Progress Indicator**: The seek bar now shows a secondary fill indicating how much of the current track has been buffered by the browser — visible in both the Player Bar and Fullscreen Player.
- **Resume on Startup**: Pressing Play after launching the app now resumes the last track at the saved playback position instead of doing nothing.
- **Album Track Hover Play Button**: Hovering over a track number in Album Detail reveals a play button for quick single-click playback.
- **Ken Burns Background**: The Fullscreen Player background now slowly drifts and zooms (Ken Burns effect) for a more cinematic feel.
- **F11 Fullscreen**: Toggle native borderless fullscreen with F11.
- **Compact Queue Now-Playing**: The current track block in the Queue Panel is now a slim horizontal strip (72 px thumbnail) instead of a full-width cover, freeing up significantly more space for the queue list on smaller screens.

### Fixed
- **GStreamer Seek Stability**: Implemented a three-layer recovery system for Linux/GStreamer seek hangs: (1) seek queuing to prevent overlapping GStreamer seeks, (2) a 2-second watchdog that triggers automatic recovery if a seek never completes, (3) an 8-second hang detector that silently recreates the audio pipeline and resumes from the last known position if playback freezes entirely.
- **Fullscreen Player**: Removed drop shadow from cover art — looks cleaner on lighter artist backgrounds.

### Changed
- **Hero Section**: Increased height (300 → 360 px) and cover art size (180 → 220 px) to prevent long album titles from clipping.
- **Player Bar**: Controls and progress bar moved closer together for a more balanced layout.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Ambient Stage**: Completely redesigned Fullscreen Player. Experience an immersive atmosphere with drifting color orbs, a "breathing" cover animation, and high-resolution artist backgrounds.
- **Improved Drag & Drop**: Rewritten Play Queue reordering for rock-solid reliability on macOS (WKWebView) and Windows (WebView2).

### Fixed
- **Linux Audio Stability**: Resolved playback stuttering when seeking under GStreamer by implementing a robust pause-seek-play sequence.
- **Data Integration**: Standardized `artistId` propagation across all track sources for better metadata consistency.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Update Notifications**: Integrated a native update check system in the sidebar that notifies you when a new version is available on GitHub.
- **Improved Settings**: Refined layout and styling for a cleaner settings experience.

### Fixed
- **UI/UX Refinements**: Polished sidebar animations and layout for better visual consistency.
- **i18n**: Added missing translations for update notifications and system status.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Extended Themes**: Selection expanded to 8 themes, including the complete Nord series (Nord, Snowstorm, Frost, Aurora).
- **Light Theme Support**: Enhanced readability for Hero and Fullscreen Player components when using light themes (Latte, Snowstorm).

### Fixed
- **Linux/Wayland Compatibility**: Fixed immediate crash on Wayland environments by forcing X11 backend for the AppImage.
- **Playback Stability**: Introduced seek debouncing to prevent audio stalls on Linux/GStreamer.
- **Windows Integration**: Improved drag-and-drop compatibility for systems using WebView2.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Image Caching**: Integrated IndexedDB-based image caching for cover art and artist images, providing significantly faster loading times for frequently accessed items.
- **Improved Artist Discovery**: Faster scrolling in the Artists list using color-coded initial-based avatars for quick visual identification.
- **Random Albums**: New discovery page for exploring your library with random album selections.
- **Help & Documentation**: Added a dedicated help page for better user onboarding.

### Changed

- **Enhanced Data Flow**: General performance improvements in server communication and state management.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Album Downloads**: Support for downloading entire albums with real-time progress tracking.

### Fixed
- **Linux GPU Compatibility**: Patched AppImage to disable DMABUF renderer, fixing EGL/GPU crashes on older hardware.
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Optimized release workflow with split jobs for better stability across platforms.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Build**: Resolved build conflicts on Ubuntu 22.04 by removing redundant dev packages (`libunwind-dev`, gstreamer dev).
- **Linux AppImage**: Configured GStreamer bundling and verified runtime environment settings.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Linux AppImage**: Integrated GStreamer bundling fix in CI/CD workflow.
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Set `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` to prevent FUSE-related issues.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-11
