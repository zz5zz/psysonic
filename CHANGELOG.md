# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.10] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- **Active Track Highlighting**: The currently playing song is highlighted in album tracklists with a subtle pulsing accent background and a play icon — persists when navigating away and returning.
- **Marquee Title in Fullscreen Player**: Long song titles now scroll smoothly as a marquee instead of being cut off.
- **Clickable Artist / Album in Player Bar**: Clicking the artist name navigates to the artist page; clicking the song title navigates to the album page. Same behaviour in the Queue panel's now-playing strip.
- **Linux App Menu Category**: Application now appears under **Multimedia** in desktop application menus (GNOME, KDE, etc.) instead of "Other".
- **Windows MSI Upgrade Support**: Added stable `upgradeCode` GUID so the MSI installer recognises previous versions and upgrades in-place without requiring manual uninstallation first.

### Fixed
- **Drag & Drop (macOS / Windows)**: Queue reordering now works correctly on macOS WKWebView and Windows WebView2. The previous fix cleared index refs synchronously in `onDragEnd`, which fires before `drop` on both platforms — refs are now cleared with a short delay so `onDropQueue` can read the correct source and destination indices.
- **Settings Dropdowns**: Language and theme selects now have a clearly visible border (was invisible against the card background).
- **Tracklist Format Column**: Removed file size and kHz from the format column — codec and bitrate only. Column moved to the far right, after duration. Width is now dynamic (`auto`).
- **`tauri.conf.json`**: Fixed invalid placement of `shortDescription`/`longDescription` (were incorrectly nested under `bundle.linux`, now at `bundle` level). Removed invalid `nsis.allowDowngrades` field.

### Changed
- **Favorites Icon**: Replaced the incorrect fork icon with a star icon in the Random Mix page, consistent with all other pages.
- **Sidebar**: Removed drag-to-resize handle. Width now adapts dynamically to the viewport via `clamp(180px, 15vw, 220px)`.
- **About Section**: Added "Developed with the support of Claude Code by Anthropic" credit. Fixed "weiterzugeben" wording in German MIT licence text.
- **Minimize to Tray**: Now disabled by default.

## [1.0.9] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Gapless Playback**: The next track's audio pipeline is silently pre-warmed before the current track ends, eliminating the gap between songs — especially noticeable on live albums and concept records.
- **Pre-caching**: Prefetched Howl instances are now actually reused for playback, giving near-instant track transitions instead of a new HTTP connection each time.
- **Buffered Progress Indicator**: The seek bar now shows a secondary fill indicating how much of the current track has been buffered by the browser — visible in both the Player Bar and Fullscreen Player.
- **Resume on Startup**: Pressing Play after launching the app now resumes the last track at the saved playback position instead of doing nothing.
- **Album Track Hover Play Button**: Hovering over a track number in Album Detail reveals a play button for quick single-click playback.
- **Ken Burns Background**: The Fullscreen Player background now slowly drifts and zooms (Ken Burns effect) for a more cinematic feel.
- **F11 Fullscreen**: Toggle native borderless fullscreen with F11.
- **Compact Queue Now-Playing**: The current track block in the Queue Panel is now a slim horizontal strip (72 px thumbnail) instead of a full-width cover, freeing up significantly more space for the queue list on smaller screens.

### Fixed
- **GStreamer Seek Stability**: Implemented a three-layer recovery system for Linux/GStreamer seek hangs: (1) seek queuing to prevent overlapping GStreamer seeks, (2) a 2-second watchdog that triggers automatic recovery if a seek never completes, (3) an 8-second hang detector that silently recreates the audio pipeline and resumes from the last known position if playback freezes entirely.
- **Fullscreen Player**: Removed drop shadow from cover art — looks cleaner on lighter artist backgrounds.

### Changed
- **Hero Section**: Increased height (300 → 360 px) and cover art size (180 → 220 px) to prevent long album titles from clipping.
- **Player Bar**: Controls and progress bar moved closer together for a more balanced layout.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Ambient Stage**: Completely redesigned Fullscreen Player. Experience an immersive atmosphere with drifting color orbs, a "breathing" cover animation, and high-resolution artist backgrounds.
- **Improved Drag & Drop**: Rewritten Play Queue reordering for rock-solid reliability on macOS (WKWebView) and Windows (WebView2).

### Fixed
- **Linux Audio Stability**: Resolved playback stuttering when seeking under GStreamer by implementing a robust pause-seek-play sequence.
- **Data Integration**: Standardized `artistId` propagation across all track sources for better metadata consistency.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Update Notifications**: Integrated a native update check system in the sidebar that notifies you when a new version is available on GitHub.
- **Improved Settings**: Refined layout and styling for a cleaner settings experience.

### Fixed
- **UI/UX Refinements**: Polished sidebar animations and layout for better visual consistency.
- **i18n**: Added missing translations for update notifications and system status.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- **Extended Themes**: Selection expanded to 8 themes, including the complete Nord series (Nord, Snowstorm, Frost, Aurora).
- **Light Theme Support**: Enhanced readability for Hero and Fullscreen Player components when using light themes (Latte, Snowstorm).

### Fixed
- **Linux/Wayland Compatibility**: Fixed immediate crash on Wayland environments by forcing X11 backend for the AppImage.
- **Playback Stability**: Introduced seek debouncing to prevent audio stalls on Linux/GStreamer.
- **Windows Integration**: Improved drag-and-drop compatibility for systems using WebView2.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Image Caching**: Integrated IndexedDB-based image caching for cover art and artist images, providing significantly faster loading times for frequently accessed items.
- **Improved Artist Discovery**: Faster scrolling in the Artists list using color-coded initial-based avatars for quick visual identification.
- **Random Albums**: New discovery page for exploring your library with random album selections.
- **Help & Documentation**: Added a dedicated help page for better user onboarding.

### Changed
- **Optimized UI**: Instant "Now Playing" status updates via local state filtering for a more responsive experience.
- **Enhanced Data Flow**: General performance improvements in server communication and state management.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Album Downloads**: Support for downloading entire albums with real-time progress tracking.

### Fixed
- **Linux GPU Compatibility**: Patched AppImage to disable DMABUF renderer, fixing EGL/GPU crashes on older hardware.
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Optimized release workflow with split jobs for better stability across platforms.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Build**: Resolved build conflicts on Ubuntu 22.04 by removing redundant dev packages (`libunwind-dev`, gstreamer dev).
- **Linux AppImage**: Configured GStreamer bundling and verified runtime environment settings.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Linux AppImage**: Integrated GStreamer bundling fix in CI/CD workflow.
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Set `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1` to prevent FUSE-related issues.

### Fixed
- **Optimized Codebase**: Integrated core fixes and performance improvements.
- **Improved Multi-Server Support**: Fixed edge cases in server switching and credential management.
- **Enhanced Security**: Switched to `crypto.getRandomValues()` for more robust auth salt generation.
