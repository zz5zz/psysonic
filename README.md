Psysonic is a beautiful desktop music player built completely from the ground up for the modern era. Utilizing **Tauri v2** and **React**, it offers a native-feeling, lightweight, and incredibly fast experience with a stunning UI inspired by the [Catppuccin](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) aesthetic. 

Designed specifically for users hosting their own music via Navidrome or other Subsonic API servers, Psysonic aims to be the best way to interact with your personal library.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Gorgeous UI**: 8 deeply integrated themes (Catppuccin series + Nord series) with smooth glassmorphism effects and micro-animations.
- ⚡ **Blazing Fast**: Built with Rust & Tauri — native audio engine (rodio), minimal RAM usage compared to typical Electron apps.
- 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n)**: Fully translated into English and German.
- 📻 **Live "Now Playing"**: See what other users on your server are currently listening to in real-time.
- 🎵 **Last.fm Scrobbling**: Full integration for scrobbling your tracks via the Navidrome server.
- 💾 **IndexedDB Caching**: Ultra-fast loading times with persistent IndexedDB image caching for cover art and artist images.
- 📀 **Album Downloads**: Support for downloading entire albums directly to your local machine.
- 💿 **Album & Artist Views**: Beautiful grid displays and detailed artist pages with related albums and color-coded initial avatars for fast browsing.
- 〰️ **Waveform Seekbar**: Canvas-based waveform with a blue-to-mauve gradient and glow effect — click or drag anywhere to seek.
- 🌊 **MilkDrop Visualizer**: Full-screen Butterchurn/MilkDrop visualizer in the Ambient Stage with hundreds of presets and smooth transitions.
- 🎛️ **Queue Management**: Drag & drop reordering, shuffle, playlist saving/loading, and server-side queue synchronization.
- 🎼 **Random Mix**: Generate a random playlist from your entire library. Filter by keyword or pick a Super Genre (Metal, Rock, Electronic, Jazz…) for a focused mix with progressive loading.
- 🔗 **In-App Browser**: Last.fm and Wikipedia links on artist pages open in a dedicated native window — no need to leave the app.
- 🔄 **Update Notifications**: Built-in update checker (on startup + every 10 minutes) that notifies you when a new version is available on GitHub.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform**: Available natively for Windows, macOS, and Linux (including Wayland support).

## ● Known Limitations

- **Linux (drag & drop cursor feedback)**: Due to a WebKitGTK limitation, the drag cursor does not reflect the drop operation type — it may appear as a "forbidden" symbol or show no indicator at all, depending on the desktop environment. Drag and drop itself works correctly.
